<body onload="draw()">

		We’ll have to let the page know that it should start drawing once the entire page is loaded. 
			—we do this by adding an onload event handler to the body tag... 
			—that calls a function called draw() that we’ll define later
			—note that there are better ways to do this, but we’ll go with this technique for now.
